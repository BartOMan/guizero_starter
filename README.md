# Exploring different ways of doing GUIs with Python GUIZERO

# FILE DESCRIPTION:
  - ## [Nelson_GUIZERO_Spinbox_Original.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/Nelson_GUIZERO_Spinbox_Original.py)
    - ### Nelson's original code 
  - ## [GUIZERO_Spinbox_SmallMods.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/GUIZERO_Spinbox_SmallMods.py)
    - ### Made small mods to Nelson's original
  - ## [GUIZERO_Bruteforce_Convert_to_Class.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/GUIZERO_Bruteforce_Convert_to_Class.py)
    - ### Converted the full app to class "SpinBoxCompleteApp", with minimal changes to code
    - ### Easy to do, but we didn't gain much 
  - ## [GUIZERO_Spinbox_Class.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/GUIZERO_Spinbox_Class.py)  
    - ### Started with the "Brute Force" conversion (above)
    - ### Class is named "SpinBoxClass";   Each class instance == a new SpinBox 
    - ### Can now generate as many spinboxes as we want
  - ## [Spinbox_Program.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/Spinbox_Program.py)  
  - ## [Slider_Program.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/Slider_Program.py)  
  - ## [Spinbox_Class_Rebuild.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/Spinbox_Class_Rebuild.py)  
    - ### Bart's fresh rebuild of the spinbox:   class 'SpinBoxRanged'
    - ### When transitioning from functions ==> classes, you often shed many variables no longer needed
    - ### Classes require fewer intermediate vars because since you don't shuttle info around
