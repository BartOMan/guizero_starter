# CRITICALLY IMPORTANT!!
# ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS CHOOSE YOUR STEP SIZE WITH THIS CRITERIA:
#   1) Step size must be <= HALF the period of your highest frequency
#       (Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem).  
#       i.e. Pick the highest frequency in your signal and make sure it has >= 2 points/period in it
#
#   2) Don't be a dumb-ass and shoot yourself in the foot if you have a choice about the
#       sampling size.  For maximizing the quality of the DFT and getting EXACT (not close, but EXACT)
#       amplitudes & frequency values, choose a sampling time (dt) to have an INTEGER number of points
#       in ALL frequency components of interest.  
#       Example:   Suppose you're sampling a digitial signal running at 10 Gbps.
#                  The basic bit width is T=1/10e9, so instead of being a dumbass and picking
#                  dt values out of thin air, choose an INTEGER NUMBER OF SAMPLES PER BIT.
#
#       Example:   Suppose you're sampling tones at 10 Hz & 20 Hz.    
#                  The highest freq is 20 Hz, with a period of 0.05 sec.   
#                  Nyquist/Shannon requires dt to be dt <= 0.025 sec, and that is perfectly adequate
#                  for extracting BOTH frequency components and BOTH amplitudes EXACTLY.
#                  The DFT should pick up 2 pure tones @ 2 precise amplitudes.
#                  This works, because dt=0.025 sec evenly divides the 10, and 20 Hz periods.
#                       Freq    Period      dt      Samples/Period
#                       10      0.1         0.025       4
#                       20      0.05        0.025       2
#                   
#   3) If you are building a time domain signal with equations, you must understand the effect
#       that a phase delay has on your time domain signals.
#       Example:   cos(2*pi*f*t + pi/3))  and   cos(2*pi*f*t) look like the same signal, with a simple
#                   phase shift in it.   But the pi/3 shift will reduce your spectral components by 
#                   cos(pi/3) or 0.5.

# KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
#   1) Frequency step:  df = 1/Tend  
#      Therefore, adjust your df freq step so that freq samples
#      land on all freq components you might have.
#   2) Sampling time dt must be small enough so that you get
#      AT LEAST 2 samples/period in your highest freq component
#   3) You must fit an integer number of dt points in your lowest
#      freq component

f = np.array( [10.0,  15.0, 20.0] )     # 2 freq components (Hz)

minF = np.min(f)                        # Lowest freq component


############################################################
# ONE CRITERIAL FOR CHOOSING TEND:
#   Force Tend to be an integer multiple of the longest
#   period (lowest freq).  This produces a smaller df
#   value that also helps hitting integer freq values
#   on the higher freq end

Tend = NumPeriods*(1/minF)              # Make Tend be an integer multiple of the longest period (lowest freq)


############################################################
# TWO CRITERIAL FOR CHOOSING SAMPLING TIME, DT:
#   1) Nyquist/Shannon sampling theorem:  
#       Need >= 2 samples/period in the smallest period (highest freq)
#   2) dt should have an integer number of points in the longest period
#       (lowest freq) or else Tend will not end up as an even multiple 
#       of the longest period

                                        # some value well below the max value

                                        # end up at the value you intended.
                                        # HOWEVER, dt is also constrained (by Nyquist/Shannon) to be <= half the period
