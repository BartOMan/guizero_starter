# Exploring different ways of doing GUIs with Python GUIZERO

# FILE DESCRIPTION:
- ## [Nelson_GUIZERO_Spinbox_Original.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/Nelson_GUIZERO_Spinbox_Original.py):  Nelson's original code
- ## [GUIZERO_Spinbox_SmallMods.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/GUIZERO_Spinbox_SmallMods.py):  Made small mods to Nelson's original
- ## [GUIZERO_Bruteforce_Convert_to_Class.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/GUIZERO_Bruteforce_Convert_to_Class.py):  
- ### Converted the full app to class "SpinBoxCompleteApp", with minimal changes to code
- ### Easy to do, but we didn't gain much 
- ## [GUIZERO_Spinbox_Class.py](https://github.com/BartOMan/guizero_starter/blob/main/src/GUIZERO_Spinbox_Class.py):  
- ### Started with the "Brute Force" conversion (above)
- ### Class is named "SpinBoxClass";   Each class instance == a new SpinBox 
- ### Can now generate as many spinboxes as we want
